title: Cognitive aspects of software design

#### Project description

Are you passionate by software design, but you believe a lot of developers don't really grasp what OOP means? The goal of this project is to understand and fix that!

This project involves:

- Devising experiments to explore the challenges developers face when trying to comprehend software design. This might involve the use of eye tracking devices or brain-computer interfaces.

- Analyze GitHub's data to understand how developers deal with design decisions in scale.

- Ethnography studies at large industry partners with the goal of observing software design in the wild.
