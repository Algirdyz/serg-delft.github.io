#### Project description

Many organisations are currently putting considerable effort into defining better and efficient Machine Learning (ML) development processes.
However, there is still a lack of standards and the number of technologies out there is overwhelming.

The long term goal of this project is to guide practitioners to build maintainable ML projects.
This problem needs to be addressed at different stages of an ML lifecycle -- from the definition of the ML problem to its deployment in production (and so on). 

In TU Delft we are already undertaking a case study with industry partners. If
you want to know more, feel free to contact Luís or Arie.
