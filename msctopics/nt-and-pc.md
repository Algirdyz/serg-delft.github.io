title: Neurotechnology and program comprehension
---

#### Project description


Comprehend complex software is definitely not an easy task for developers. And yet, developers have to understand the systems they work on virtually at every second. Lots of research have been dedicated to understand how developers comprehend software, which tools facilitate the task, and what challenges they still face. Even psychologists and cognitive researchers have given their shot on the topic [1]. More recently, researchers have been using fMRIs to find correlations between brain activity and code comprehensibility [2, 3].
And with our access to (somewhat cheap) bio/neuro technology, such as eye tracking, EEG, and GSRs, researchers have now a completely new research method to explore [4]. 

This project involves:

- Explore how machine learning algorithms can be used to provide useful recommendations to developers.

- Ethnography studies at large industry partners to evaluate the practical effectiveness of such recommendations.
