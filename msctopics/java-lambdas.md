title: Improving Java's Lambda stream debugging 
---

#### Project description

When Java introduced lambdas and streams as a native feature in Java 8, it was expected that there would be widespread adoption of this feature. However, that has not really been the case. One of the principal issues with lambdas in its current implementation is that when something goes wrong inside the stream, the stack trace message is very hard to understand and in many cases is considered to be quite useless. This raises the question as to whether we can change the Java Runtime Environment error messaging when it comes to failures in Java streams.
