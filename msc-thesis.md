title: Master thesis projects

Below you can find a list of current and past [SERG](/) Masters projects.
You can browse through the list in order to get an idea for the sort of MSc projects we run at our labs.

If you're a Delft MSc student and you like projects such as those listed here, you can contact us to
see if there are opportunities for an MSc project for you at our labs.
This is usually possible, but mainly depends on the time we have available for supervising you.
We also maintain a list of [available open projects](msc-projects.html), but this list is a subset of what is really possible since the actual project opportunities change a lot.

The projects are sorted in reverse chronological order by end year. 
You can sort on other columns 
by clicking the appropriate column headers.
Projects in progress are listed first, followed by separate tables for theses completed in 
each year, starting in 2003.
For completed projects, you can click on the student's name for an abstract or 
an electronic copy of the thesis.
If you did your masters thesis in the software engineering group and you can't find your thesis below,
contact your supervisor, and ask him/her to add your thesis.
