### Doing your MSc thesis at SERG

For students participating in the Delft computer science master's programme we have several openings for MSc projects in our research labs.

Optionally, you can start your research with a 7-8 week literature survey (IN4306). This assignment is concluded with a report containing an overview of the state-of-the-art in a particular branch of research, along with a presentation.

The actual research is done in your Master's thesis (IN5000). A Master's thesis typically involves the construction or extension of a software artifact. A thesis then describes the construction of this software artifact, together with an evaluation of either the software artifact itself, or the research question that can be solved with the software artifact. The nominal period for doing your Master's thesis is 30 weeks and is concluded by a written report (the Master thesis) and a presentation.

### Selecting a topic

We maintain a list of [Past and Current MSc Projects](msc-theses.html), which will give you an impression of the sort of projects you can do. The list also includes pointers to the PDF versions of most of the MSc theses completed in our labs. In addition to that, you can find a list of open MSc projects
below. This list is certainly not exhaustive

You can make an appointment with one of the SERG group members to see what projects are currently open, or you can propose your own project. Note that if you want us to supervise you, a constraint in doing your own proposal is that you have to make sure that there is a connection with the research we conduct at our labs. You can contact the following persons for more information:

* Mauricio Aniche:
* Arie van Deursen: Software testing, software architecture, DevOps.
* Georgios Gousios: Software Analytics, software ecosystems.
* Felienne Hermans:
* Annibale Panichella: Search-based Software Engineering
* Rini van Solingen: Agile methods, SCRUM, distributed software development.
* Andy Zaidman: Software evolution, software re-engineering, mining software repositories, software testing.
