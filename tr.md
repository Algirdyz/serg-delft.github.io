title: SERG Technical Report Series
---

The TU Delft Software Engineering Research Group has maintained a list of technical reports since 2006, number TUD-SERG-20xx-abc. [All reports](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/search/ISSN%201872-5392?collection=research) can be found in the [TU Delft Repository](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/search/ISSN%201872-5392?collection=research) through the appropriate query.

Technical reports include a verbatim pdf of the camera-ready version of the underlying publication (i.e., they are [postprints](https://avandeursen.com/2016/11/06/green-open-access-faq/#what-is-a-postprint)), possibly extended with extra appendices that exceed the page limit of the publication. The corresponding wrapper is created in latex using a [SERG report style](https://github.com/SERG-Delft/serg-report-style).

In the years 2006-2017 the majority of the group's publications were also made available as techreport: With the university wide adoption of pure at TU Delft for sharing postprints, we [started using Pure](https://avandeursen.com/2016/12/07/self-archiving-publications-in-elsevier-pure-at-tu-delft/) for techreports that are just verbatim copies of published papers. We still use techreports for papers that need an extra appendix, which we then also upload into pure.
