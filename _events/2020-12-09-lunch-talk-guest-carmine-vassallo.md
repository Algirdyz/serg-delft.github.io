An effective and efficient application of Continuous Integration (CI) and Delivery (CD) requires software projects to follow certain principles and good practices. However, configuring such a CI/CD pipeline is challenging and developers can introduce misconfigurations that potentially violate CD principles ("CD smells"). In this talk, Dr. Vassallo will introduce CD-Linter, a semantic linter that can automatically identify four different CD smells in build-pipeline configuration files. The talk will also contain the extended study that has been conducted with real developers to understand the value of this tool in production environments.
