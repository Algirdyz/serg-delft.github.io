### Recent and upcoming activities

### Introduction

Modern software projects are more than just the code that comprises them: teams
follow specific development processes; the code runs on servers or mobile phones
and produces runtime logs; users talk about the software in forums like
StackOverflow and GitHub and rate the product in app stores. The software is
part of a collection of similar applications and depends on external code or
service APIâ€™s to deliver its functionality. Modern software teams need data to
make informed decisions that enable continuous, feedback-driven improvement.

At the Software Analytics lab, we work to make software analytics a core asset for software development teams. Our research touches topics such as computer-supported collaborative work (CSCW), big data systems, software engineering processes, software (static and dynamic) analysis and data science.

Currently, we focus on the following 3 research lines, even though we are always open for new ideas:

* **Engineering for (software) analytics**: creating platforms for data ingestion, integration and querying in a streaming fashion

* **Software ecosystems**: Constructing call-graphs at the ecosystem level

* **So**:

The following slides give a high level overview of our recent work:
