Welcome to the Software Engineering Research Group!

_Nice group photo here_

Software engineering is concerned with methods and techniques for building high
quality software systems. This not only includes software construction, but also
requirements analysis, design, system integration, testing, deployment, and
making changes to software systems after their first release.

## Our Mission

The mission of the TU Delft Software Engineering Research Group is
1. to develop a deep understanding of how people build and evolve software systems;
2. to develop novel methods, techniques, theories, and tools that advance the way in which software is built and adjusted;
3. to ensure that our research results have a lasting impact in software development practice; and
4. to offer students an education that prepares them to take a leading role in complex software development projects.

## Our Research

The research of the TU Delft Software Engineering Research Group is characterized
by a focus on empirical research, conducted in close collaboration with software
development practice. Topics of interest include software testing, software
architecture, end user programming, modern code review, and collaborative and
distributed software development.

We conduct our research in mixed teams, in collaboration with practitioners and
international researchers. We publish our research in the top venues in the
field. Members of SERG actively serve
in organizational and program committees of these conferences and editorial
boards of these journals.

We are strong supporters of open science, and self-archive our publications in
our Technical Reports series. We aim at sharing our research prototypes as open
source tools whenever possible.
