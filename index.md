## Our Mission

The mission of the TU Delft Software Engineering Research Group is
1. to develop a deep understanding of how people build and evolve software systems;
2. to develop novel methods, techniques, theories, and tools that advance the way in which software is built and adjusted;
3. to ensure that our research results have a lasting impact in software development practice; and
4. to offer students an education that prepares them to take a leading role in complex software development projects.

## Our Research

The research of the TU Delft Software Engineering Research Group is
characterized by a focus on empirical research, conducted in close collaboration
with software development practice. Topics of interest include software testing,
software architecture, end user programming, modern code review, and
collaborative and distributed software development.

We conduct our research in mixed teams, in collaboration with practitioners and
international researchers. We publish our research in the top venues in the
field. Members of SERG actively serve in organizational and program committees
of these conferences and editorial boards of these journals.

We are strong supporters of open science, and self-archive our publications in
our Technical Reports series. We aim at sharing our research prototypes as open
source tools whenever possible.

To accomplish our research goals, our research is organized across 4
research lines:

* [Search Based Software Engineering](sbse.html)
* [Software Analytics](softanalytics.html)
* [Software Engineering Education](softedu.html)
* [Software Testing](softtesting.html)
