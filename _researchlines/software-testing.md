## Introduction



* **Regression Testing**: 
Is your test suite too large for the retes-all approach? Do you want to minimize the cost of regression testing in your DevOps pipelines without losing its fault-detection capability? We use SSBSE techniques to find a minimal yet representative subset of test cases to execute after each commit. We also use SSBSE and ML to prioritize your test cases based on past test execution data [[12]](https://apanichella.github.io/publication/ieee-tse2018f/).

* **Mutation Testing**: 
We work to provide immediate feedback for developers about the quality (effectiveness) of the test suites. To this aim, we use mutation testing as a swiss army knife and ML to reduce the cost of mutation analysis [[13]](https://apanichella.github.io/publication/icst2018/).
