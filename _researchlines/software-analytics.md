## Introduction

Modern software projects are more than just the code that comprises them: teams
follow specific development processes; the code runs on servers or mobile phones
and produces runtime logs; users talk about the software in forums like
StackOverflow and GitHub and rate the product in app stores. The software is
part of a collection of similar applications and depends on external code or
service APIâ€™s to deliver its functionality. Modern software teams need data to
make informed decisions that enable continuous, feedback-driven improvement.

At the Software Analytics lab, we work to make software analytics a core asset for software development teams. Our research touches topics such as computer-supported collaborative work (CSCW), big data systems, software engineering processes, software reliability, software analysis and data science.

Currently, we focus on the following 3 research lines, even though we are always open for new ideas:

* **Engineering for (software) analytics**: creating platforms for data ingestion, integration and querying in a streaming fashion. Related projects:

    * [Codefeedr](http://codefeedr.org) A platform to ingest and process
      software analytics data in a streaming fashion.
    * [TravisTorrent](https://travistorrent.testroots.org) Collects Travis build
      data, combines them with GHTorrent and offers them back to the research
      community.
    * [GHTorrent](https://ghtorrent.org) Collects all data from the

* **Software ecosystems**: We build ecosystem wide, versioned call graphs out
of package networks to make studies such as precise security vulnerability
tracking, software license tracking, data-based API evolution etc possible.

* **Software reliability analytics**: We work to make APIs more reliable by
  combining static analysis with search-based test generation.

The following slides give a high level overview of our recent work:
